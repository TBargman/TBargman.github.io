([Just the repo for me, thanks](https://github.com/TBargman/TBargman.github.io/tree/main))

Any web code hosted here is written in my free time at my day job using a mobile IDE. As a result, these pages are intended to run in mobile browsers and will probably look/behave weirdly elsewhere. Don't take it too seriously lol.



### [FH5 DB][fh5db]
[[Source]](https://github.com/TBargman/TBargman.github.io/tree/main/FH5DB)
What, an actual finished project? Yeah mostly! I'm a big fan of the Forza Horizon games, and with over 900 cars in Horizon 5, it'd be nice to have a way to browse through all of them and see at least the basic related stats/info. With a few custom components included, this mainly started as a project to dynamically create a form used to filter through JSON data. A FilterForm class takes a JS object (and an array of chosen filters) and creates the entire form from it. Comes complete with fancy animations and dynamically loading results as you scroll down the page. As with everything else posted here, this page looks best on mobile browsers and will probably look weird elsewhere.

### [Garden thing][garden]
[[Source]](https://github.com/TBargman/TBargman.github.io/tree/main/garden)
My first "big" project I started as a way to get my feet wet with Javascript. It was very early in my journey and so, inevitably, the code became a wild and highly unorganized spaghetti mess 🤢 I don't see myself going back to this without starting over from scratch.

### [Canvas Shenanigans][canvas]
My current obsession is drawing things programmatically, and the HTML5 canvas is fun to play around with. 

### [Yotsee][yah]
[[Source]](https://github.com/TBargman/TBargman.github.io/tree/main/yotsee)
Man, I miss web games. Too bad flash is ded :(\
Oh well, JS can do it all these days. So here's a classic dice-rolling game. It's also my first solid attempt at creating web components in the shadow DOM; I used custom input elements on the game's setup screen. Eventually I'll add the ability to play against the computer.

### [Infinite Carousel Demo][infcar]
[[Source]](https://github.com/TBargman/TBargman.github.io/tree/main/infcar)
A little test for a carousel that scrolls left/right to your heart's content, with items' content updating as you go. Written specifically for mobile and uses touch events instead of mouse/pointer.

### [Calendar Web App][cal]
[[Source]](https://github.com/TBargman/TBargman.github.io/tree/main/calendar)
Uses the infinite carousel idea for a scrollable calendar, complete with daily schedule views. (Incomplete with the infinite carousel that doesn't work yet, and the ability to add events to your schedule lmao)

### [Colors][colorgen]
[[Source]](https://github.com/TBargman/TBargman.github.io/tree/main/colorgen)
I have a thing for colors, and find myself using HSL sliders often. "Why not make my own?" I thought. Another experiment in creating web components. Also includes a random color generator that gives you hex, RGB and HSL values.

### [Rock, Paper, Scissors Sim][rps]
[[Source]](https://github.com/TBargman/TBargman.github.io/tree/main/rps)\
Inspired by [this video](https://www.tiktok.com/@cbmemess/video/7424512892726430979).\
Wow, collision detection is a bitch. This should've been done with Canvas anyway haha. It's not very exciting, as icons target each other too well and it's all over quickly.
