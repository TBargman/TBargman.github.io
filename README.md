A "portfolio" site of my unfinished bullshit.

Any web code hosted here is written in my free time at my day job using a mobile IDE. As a result, these pages are intended to run in mobile browsers and will probably look/behave weirdly elsewhere. Don't take it too seriously lol.

([Just the repo for me, thanks](https://github.com/TBargman/TBargman.github.io/tree/main))



### [Garden thing][garden]
My first "big" project I started as a way to get my feet wet with Javascript. It was very early in my journey and so, inevitably, the code became a wild and highly unorganized spaghetti mess. I don't see myself going back to this without starting over from scratch.

### [Canvas Shenanigans][canvas]
My current obsession is drawing things programmatically, and the HTML5 canvas is fun to play around with. 

### [Yotsee][yah]
Man, I miss web games. Too bad flash is ded :(
Oh well, JS can do it all these days. So here's a classic dice-rolling game. It's also my first solid attempt at creating web components in the shadow DOM; I used custom input elements on the game's setup screen. Eventually I want to add the ability to play against the computer.

### [Infinite Carousel Demo][infcar]
A little test for a carousel that scrolls left/right to your heart's content, with items' content updating as you go. Written specifically for mobile and uses touch events instead of mouse/pointer.

### [Calendar Web App][cal]
Uses the infinite carousel idea for a scrollable calendar, complete with daily schedule views. (Incomplete with the infinite carousel that doesn't work yet, and the ability to add events to your schedule lmao)

### [Colors][colorgen]
I have a thing for colors, and find myself using HSL sliders often. "Why not make my own?" I thought. Another experiment in creating web components. Also includes a random color generator that gives you hex, RGB and HSL values. 

### [Rock, Paper, Scissors Sim][rps]

Wow, collision detection is a bitch. This should've been done with anyway Canvas haha. It's not very exciting, as icons target each other too well and it's all over quickly.
